 <h2>Kantar Media Streaming Sensor iOS User Manual</h2>
 </div>
<div>
<h3 style="color: red"> SDK 1.12.0 and higher</h3>
<p> Starting from SDK version 1.12.0,  we are dropping the usage of IDFA  addressing  the privacy changes that apple introduced in iOS 14.</p>
<p> The constructor that disables the use of IDFA is now removed </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style="color: red">AppStore Submission with iOS 11</h3>
<p>Please be aware that if you do not include the AdSupport.framework in your app you will have to disable the use of the IDFA via API in the constructor. Otherwise your App may be rejected from the AppStore for legal reasons.</p>
<p>For more information see the API documentation of the constructor.</p>
</div>

 <div style="background-color: grey;" >
 <div align="center">

 <h3>Migration to iOS 9 </h3>
 
 </div>
 <h2 style="color:blue;">From version 1.4.0, KMA measuerment libraries will not support iOS6 any more. Kantar Media Streaming library components are all with KMA as prefix from this version, please read more in the API documentation.</h2>
 <h3>URL Scheme</h3>
 <p>Starting on iOS 9, iOS apps will have to declare what URL schemes they would like to be able to check for and open in the configuration files (plist file) of the app as it is submitted to Apple. So if your application is combining with a specific "Panel App" (e.g. Virtualmeter App), please register the URL scheme in your application, the syntax is as following:</p>
 
 <div style="border:1px solid black;">
 <br>&lt;key&gt;LSApplicationQueriesSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;array&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;string&gt;<span class="marker"><span style="color:#0000CD;">@newPanelApp</span>&lt;</span>/string&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;string&gt;<span style="color:#0000CD;"><span class="marker">@oldPanelApp</span></span>&lt;/string&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/array&gt;</div>
 
 <p>please contact your library provider for the URL scheme</p>
 
 
 <h3>App Transport Security (ATS)</h3>
 <p>Starting from iOS 9.0, App Transport Security (ATS) enforces best practices in the secure connections between an app and its back end. Migrating from http to https has to be planed for the more secure communication. However for this moment, if you decide to keep http in KMA_Spring library, please add following into the project plist file, otherwise please activate ssl on in the library. </p>
 
 <div style="border:1px solid black;">
 &lt;key&gt;NSAppTransportSecurity&lt;/key&gt;
 <br>&lt;dict&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;key&gt;NSAllowsArbitraryLoads&lt;/key&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;false/&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;key&gt;NSExceptionDomains&lt;/key&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;dict&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;key&gt;<span style="color:#0000CD;">@domain</span>&lt;/key&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;dict&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;key&gt;NSIncludesSubdomains&lt;/key&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;true/&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;key&gt;NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads&lt;/key&gt;

 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/dict&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/dict&gt;
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/dict&gt;</div>
 <p><i><span class="marker"><span style="color:#0000CD;">if</span></span> ATS is not enabled in your application, as NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = true, then you don't need to modify anything.
 </i></p>
 
 <h3>Notification registration for debug purpose</h3>
 
 <p>From KMA streaming iOS version 1.4.4, a notification is inserted into the implementation, so that the customers are able to retrieve the requests sent by the library, see more info #KMA_STREAMING_DEBUGINTERFACE_NOTIFICATION. The notification contains a NSDictionary object, with the keys, "Request" and "Statuscode". With the following implementation, it is sample to fetch the debug information.</p>
 <pre><code>
 [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@ selector(handleApplicationEvent:) name:KMA_STREAMING_DEBUGINTERFACE_NOTIFICATION object:nil];
 &minus; (void) handleApplicationEvent:(NSNotification *)n {
 if(KMA_STREAMING_DEBUGINTERFACE_NOTIFICATION == [n name]) {
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have the implementation
 }
 }
 </code></pre>
 <p><i>Please Note: Set the debug mode (KMA_SpringStreams.debug) to false in your live product, otherwise there will be a debug flag in the measurement request.
 </i></p>
 
 <h3>BitCode</h3>
 <p>Bitcode is a new feature on iOS 9, an intermediate representation of a compiled program. Now you have the new KMA_SpringStreams lib with bitcode enabled, for your application you have the chance to enable or disable the bitcode service.</p>
 </div>
 
 <h3>Integration into Swift Project</h3>
  <div>
 <p>If the project is a Swift project, a swift bridging header file is required for the integration, more tutorial can be found here:  https://kantarmedia.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/public/pages/159726961/Tutorial+on+how+to+import+KMA+measurement+Objective-C+library+into+Swift+project</p>
 </div>
 
 <h3>Offline Mode</h3>
 <p>Kantar Media Streaming Sensor iOS has feature so called "offlineMode". This mode can be switched on and off by using public API: KMA_SpringStreams.offlineMode.
 If the lib is configured to offlineMode, KMA_SpringStreams library will hold all requests in a local buffer and send them when the device goes back online. KMA_SpringStreams lib checks the Internet connection regularly by using the iOS Timer and send the data as soon as possible.
 Please notice:
 -# Old requests will be dropped if too many requests pump into local buffer for the limitation in buffer size. The default buffer size is 500. The data will be stored in a local file, so the lib will not lose the requests even if the application terminates.
 -# KMA_SpringStreams lib tries to send the requests in a fixed rate, 10 seconds by default, and sends them if device is online.</p>

<h3>Chromecast support</h3>
<div>
  <p>
    In order to measure videos, which are casted to a Chromecast device, the KMA_MediaPlayerAdapter_Chromecast has to be used or extended instead of the default KMA_MediaPlayerAdapter. The KMA_MediaPlayerAdapter_Chromecast automatically detects, if the video is played locally on the iOS device or if it is casted to a connected Chromecast device.
  </p>
  <p>
    !Important! Current Googlecast-SDK version 4.3.2 has a bug and is not working correctly with iOS 12. In order to use Chromecast on iOS 12 devices, the Googlecast-SDK version 3.4.0 must be used until the bug has been fixed by Google.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>UDID</h3>
 * <table>
 * <tr><th> </th><th>Device ID(did)</th><th>Advertising ID(ai)</th><th>MAC ID(mid)</th><th>ID_For_Vendor(ifv)</th></tr>
 
 <tr><td>iOS 4</td><td><div align="center">---</div></td><td><div align="center">---</div></td><td>MAC ID(mid)</td><td><div align="center">---</div></td></tr>
 <tr><td>iOS 5</td><td><div align="center">---</div></td><td><div align="center">---</div></td><td>MAC ID(mid)</td><td><div align="center">---</div></td></tr>
 <tr><td>iOS 6</td><td><div align="center">---</div></td><td>Advertising ID(ai)</td><td>MAC ID(mid)</td><td>ID_For_Vendor(ifv)</td></tr>

 <tr><td>iOS 9</td><td><div align="center">---</div></td><td>Advertising ID(ai)</td><td><div align="center">---</div></td><td>ID_For_Vendor(ifv)</td></tr>
 * </table>
 
 <p>Considering that the Apple private policy is changing all the time, Kantar Media Sensor libs have to adapt different UDIDs for identifying the end user's devices.</p>
 <p>
 -# Since iOS 6, device ID and mac ID are not available anymore,
 -# Switch to Advertising ID and ID_For_Vendor</p>
 
 <p><i>Please attention: Apple will reject all the applications which retrieve advertising ID but with no advertising content provided. So Advertising-Framework is linked as optional in Kantar Media Sensor libs, If the Advertising ID should be used as udid, please import Advertising-Framework into your projects.</i></p>

<h3>NextUID</h3>
<div>
  <p>
  Beginning with the Kantar Media Streaming Library 1.9.0, we are providing a getter-method to retrieve the next UID that will be used when tracking is started in the streaming sensor.
Developers can call getNextUID() to retrieve the UID of the stream, which is played next.
The track() method will now accept additional parameter handle which is UID retrieved before. 
  </p>
</div>
 
 <h3>Handling Control Center</h3>
 <div>
 <p>The following scenario may occur during measurement: When opening the control center, the measurement will be started with a new uid after closing the control center.</p>
 <p>
 Our recommendation to handle this is as follows.
 When calling the track method in applicationDidBecomeActive lifecycle hook, please be aware that opening and closing the control center will trigger the action (applicationDidBecomeActive lifecycle method). To avoid this please use applicationWillResignActive lifecycle hook which is invoked when the control center is opened and store a flag to know that the app actually did not go to background but control center is opened. Do necessary changes (like pausing video if desired). On applicationDidBecomeActive please check whether the flag is stored and call the track method only if it is not. This will ensure uninterrupted measurement of streams.
 </p>
 </div>
<h3>WKWebView</h3>
<div> <p>
Recently, Apple started warning users that it is going to stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs. Hence, we have removed that.</p>
<p>Starting from kantarmedia Streaming 1.11.0 we are replacing UIWebview with WKWebView  for retreiving Useragent. The integrator must add Webkit framework into the application for the app to run properly.
 </p>
</div>
<h3>UI Pasteboard </h3>
<div><p>Starting from kantarmedia Streaming 1.11.1 we are replacing URLScheme with UIPasteboard  for IDFA Exchange . The integrator must add -ObjC linker flag to build settings for the app to run properly.
</p></div>
<h3>Chromecast</h3>
<p>
Starting from streaming 1.11.1 we are changing the way we measure data in chomecast context. Instead of measuring everything from the sender application we created a new custom reciever which you will receive with kantarmedia-streaming-js artifact.
To achieve this you need to include all the files that are included inside src folder in the package except adapter into your project.
And On cast session connected(didStartSession) and resume(didResumeSession) events, you need  to call <strong>sendMessage</strong> method of CastSessionManager class
</p>
 
 <h3>NOTICE</h3>
 <p><i>Please Note: Some components in Kantar Media Sensor libs are running in background threads. Please keep the initialization and usage of Kantar Media Sensor libs in your main thread, Kantar Media Sensor libs will not block your UI display.

 PanelApp Switch: Url Scheme</td>
 <td>
 New Feature</td>
 <td>
 <p>
 Since KMA_SpringStreams 1.1.0, the lib will try to call a corresponding PanelApp (by URL Scheme, happens in the initialization phase, only called once if ifv is not changed since last lauch), and send ifv (identifier_for_vendor) and related parameters to the PanelApp. This mechanism is designed for identifying each single device owned by the end user. (ifv is unique for each vendor, but not globally)</p>
 <p>
 For adapting this mechanism, the clients of KMA_SpringStreams lib has to implement their own PanelApp and also import KMA_Spring/KMA_SpringStreams lib into it.</p>

 * Kantar Media Streaming Sensor lib checks the internet connection regularly by using a Timer and send the data as soon as possible. Please notice:\n
 * -# Old requests would be droped if too many requests pump into local buffer for the limitation in buffer size. The default buffer size is 500. The data will be stored in a local file, so we would not lose the requests even if the applicaiton terminated.
 * -# Kantar Media Streaming Sensor lib tries to send the requests in a fixed rate, 10 seconds by default, and sends them if device is online. This is achieved by using Apple NSTimer.
